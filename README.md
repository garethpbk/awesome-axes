# Awesome Axes

Cool website about guitars!

## Getting Started

`yarn`

## How to Use

`yarn start` to start a development server on `localhost:3000`. `yarn build` to build for distribution. It is a `create-react-app` project so the typical process for that.

## Deployment

Netlify is a good choice. Is deployed at [https://awesome-axes.netlify.com/](https://awesome-axes.netlify.com/).
